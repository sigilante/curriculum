- `csl01` Building Hoon
  - Explain the compiler stack, including `$hoon`, `+ream`, `+mint`, `$type`, `+nest`, `+play`.
  - Utilize vase-mode Hoon and explain its _raison d'Ãªtre_:  `+slap`, `+slop`, `+slot`, `+slam`
  - Exercise:  Implement a rune (block comment?).
  - Exercise:  Write your own `+slam`.
- `csl02` Evaluating Nock
  - Explain each Nock rule.
