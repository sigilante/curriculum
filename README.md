# curriculum

_A comprehensive and up-to-date developer education platform for Urbit._

This project organizes developer capabilities into a hierarchy of competencies (“objectives”), competency clusters (“lessons”), and ultimately developer education paths.

Given a particular target capability, we can answer the question of exactly what parts of the system you need to learn to be competent at your task.

More or less, we consider the world of Urbit developers to fall into six levels:

1. Tyro
2. Amateur
3. Workaday
4. Master
5. Wizard
6. Client-side

We organize curriculum into series which describe the target transformation:

1. 100	Tyro→Amateur
2. 200	Amateur→Workaday
3. 300	Workaday→Master
4. 400	Master→Wizard
5. 500	Wizard++

Particular paths can be traced through the competency cluster dependencies:

I am currently working on making this more legible, and ultimately will use this to rework Hoon School, Hoon 101, and organize access to recommended study materials and documentation.

Next steps:
- map all runes into this scheme (mostly done, but some runes are never covered, need to decide on this)
- produce summative assessments for each objective
- produce formative assessments for each lesson
- collate/produce content
